🎯 Objective
Build a backend server that:

Generates SDK auth tokens

Receives HyperVerge webhook events

Fetches transaction logs and final outputs from HV APIs

🌐 Step 1: Set Up a Public Backend Server
Your server must be publicly accessible so HyperVerge can send webhook events.

Choose one:

Option A — Local + Ngrok
Run backend locally

Use Ngrok to expose a public HTTPS URL

Option B — Cloud Deployment
Deploy backend on AWS / GCP / Azure / etc.

Expose a public HTTPS endpoint

🛠 Backend API Requirements
1️⃣ Auth API
Endpoint GET /auth 

Purpose
Generates a short-lived HyperVerge auth token for SDK initialization.

Requirements
Call HV authentication API to generate expiring token

Token validity must be 30 minutes

Return token in response to frontend

📖 Ref:
https://documentation.hyperverge.co/other-resources/authentication#method-2---using-expiring-tokens

2️⃣ Results Webhook Listener
Endpoint POST /results

Purpose
Receives webhook event from HyperVerge after a transaction is completed.

Flow
Configure this endpoint as your HV Webhook URL

HV backend will send a POST request when SDK flow finishes

Extract transactionId (trxnId) from webhook payload

Call HV Results (Logs) API using this transaction ID
https://documentation.hyperverge.co/accessing-results/results-api

Store or log the response (recommended)

Respond back to HV with HTTP 200 OK

3️⃣ Outputs Fetch API
Endpoint POST /outputs 

Purpose
Allows frontend to fetch final processed outputs after SDK completion.

Flow
Frontend → Backend

Sends transactionId in request body

Backend Steps

Receive transaction ID

Call HV Results (Logs) API

Call HV Outputs API
https://documentation.hyperverge.co/accessing-results/output_api

Return Outputs API response to frontend

🧠 Functional Understanding
🔹 Results Webhook
A notification from HV backend informing your server that a transaction has completed. It contains the transaction reference, not full results.

🔹 Results API (Logs API)
Used after webhook reception to fetch transaction processing details and logs.

🔹 Outputs API
Provides the final KYC outputs, extracted data, and verification decisions.
