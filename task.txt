🎯 Objective
Build a backend server that:

Generates SDK auth tokens

Receives HyperVerge webhook events

Fetches transaction logs and final outputs from HV APIs

🌐 Step 1: Set Up a Public Backend Server
Your server must be publicly accessible so HyperVerge can send webhook events.

Choose one:

Option A — Local + Ngrok
Run backend locally

Use Ngrok to expose a public HTTPS URL

Option B — Cloud Deployment
Deploy backend on AWS / GCP / Azure / etc.

Expose a public HTTPS endpoint

🛠 Backend API Requirements
1️⃣ Auth API
Endpoint GET /auth 

Purpose
Generates a short-lived HyperVerge auth token for SDK initialization.

Requirements
Call HV authentication API to generate expiring token

Token validity must be 30 minutes

Return token in response to frontend

📖 Ref:
https://documentation.hyperverge.co/other-resources/authentication#method-2---using-expiring-tokens

2️⃣ Results Webhook Listener
Endpoint POST /results

Purpose
Receives webhook event from HyperVerge after a transaction is completed.

Flow
Configure this endpoint as your HV Webhook URL

HV backend will send a POST request when SDK flow finishes

Extract transactionId (trxnId) from webhook payload

Call HV Results (Logs) API using this transaction ID
https://documentation.hyperverge.co/accessing-results/results-api

Store or log the response (recommended)

Respond back to HV with HTTP 200 OK

3️⃣ Outputs Fetch API
Endpoint POST /outputs 

Purpose
Allows frontend to fetch final processed outputs after SDK completion.

Flow
Frontend → Backend

Sends transactionId in request body

Backend Steps

Receive transaction ID

Call HV Results (Logs) API

Call HV Outputs API
https://documentation.hyperverge.co/accessing-results/output_api

Return Outputs API response to frontend

🧠 Functional Understanding
🔹 Results Webhook
A notification from HV backend informing your server that a transaction has completed. It contains the transaction reference, not full results.

🔹 Results API (Logs API)
Used after webhook reception to fetch transaction processing details and logs.

🔹 Outputs API
Provides the final KYC outputs, extracted data, and verification decisions.


HyperKYC Web SDK
Integrate the Web SDK and launch the workflow created

Based on final status, display corresponding message to user

Inspect the Network tab from the browser - Start to end of the flow
