    Issue: Data missing for key `reason`
    
    How do you debug this? 
    
3. Client HV has reported yet another issue. They have a very simple flow where the OCR on PAN card is done and the user completed the journey and got approved. They received auto approved status from SDK and from results API initially. But they then opened case management and saw the status was user cancelled instead. They thought case management is incorrect and called results API. To their surprise, it is also returning the status as user cancelled. How would you debug this? What can be the possible reasons for it?

4. Client HV’s issues never end. They are back with another issue. User completed the journey but the updated status does not reflect on the case management or results API. Can you help them why this happened?
